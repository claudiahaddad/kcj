      <p><div> <i> By Lynn Andriani - Huffington Post  </i>   </div>
        It’s a given that, these days, almost any employment search is going to begin online (CareerBuilder’s 2013 Candidate
        Behavior Study shows that about 80 percent of job seekers use job boards). The truth is, though, that the majority of
        positions you see posted are already filled, says Nicole Williams, career expert for LinkedIn. Just 18 percent of external
        hires can be attributed to job boards, according to the recruiting site CareerXroads. Successful candidates use boards to
        learn about the kinds of roles a company they’re interested in is trying to fill (and what specific skills it’s looking for),

        This fall, I’ve had the most unusual teaching assignment, a class titled Social Media, Blogging and Business.  Having to teach
        the class has made me more aware of potential social media uses by students.I recommend that students use Linkedin to professionally
        present themselves via social media.  Simultaneously, I recommend that students don’t use Facebook (or use Facebook only under a pseudonym)....

<li style = "list-style-type: none;" ><h3>16 Mistakes Employees Make When Trying To Get A Promotion</h3>
  <p><div> <i>By Jacquelyn Smith - Forbes </i> </div>
      Asking for a promotion can be one of the most stressful experiences in your career--especially in today's uncertain economy. Why? “Because you
      know you're putting yourself at some level of risk,” says Lynn Taylor, a national workplace expert and author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant;
      How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior and Thrive in Your Job. “The often legitimate fears of appearing too ambitious, or not being focused enough on
      doing your best work, can trigger unnecessary missteps. However, if you're strategic about your pursuit, you can change the frustrating dynamic of feeling undervalued.”
