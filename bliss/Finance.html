    <li style= "list-style-type: none;"><h3> How To Start Investing With Just $1,000 </h3>
      <p><div><i> By Rob Berger - Forbes</i> </div>
        Recently a Forbes reader I'll call Susan emailed me about how to get started investing. Here's what she said:
        I just turned 18 years old, and would like to invest young so that I can have life-long investments. I'm interested
        in investing in mutual funds, and somewhere where there will not be outrageously high trading fees or commissions.
        It would need to be somewhere that can accept a minimum of $1,000, which is what I am having trouble with finding.
        Being extremely new at this, I have no clue how to compare multiple companies, or which company will be the most
        beneficial in the long run. I was wondering if you had any recommendations or advice for a beginner like me? I read
        your article [I believe she was referring to this one on how to invest for the first time], but I am still at a loss
        for which company I should go with....

      <p><div><i>By Ron Lieber - New York Times</i></div>
        While most workers are responsible for their own retirement savings these days, high schools don’t have required classes on 401(k)’s
        and Individual Retirement Accounts (I.R.A.s). And colleges usually don’t teach anything about Roth I.R.A.s or 403(b)’s. That’s where
        we come in. Here is what you need to know about saving for life after you stop working and getting on the path toward a comfortable
        retirement, no matter your career or the size of your paycheck....

    <li style= "list-style-type: none;" ><h3>How to protect your retirement savings from a crash</h3>
      <p><div><i>By Katie Brockman - CNN</i></div>
        It's perfectly normal for the stock market to bounce around like a roller coaster. But here's the problem: According to a survey
        by BlackRock, 66% of investors believe future gains will be roughly equivalent to what they've seen in recent years, and 17% believe
        they'll be even higher.On top of that, many investors are holding a few flawed assumptions about how much they'll actually need to
        retire. While 56% of investors believe they'll have enough money to retire, 65% said they were unaware that expected returns are
        predicted to be far lower in the future than they've been in the past.So what can you do to protect your retirement savings in the
        event that the market crashes?
