  <h3><strong>Why Is Sleep Important?</strong></h3>
    <p>Sleep plays a vital role in good health and well-being throughout your life. Getting enough quality
      sleep at the right times can help protect your mental health, physical health, quality of life, and safety.
      The way you feel while you're awake depends in part on what happens while you're sleeping. During sleep,
      your body is working to support healthy brain function and maintain your physical health. In children and
      teens, sleep also helps support growth and development.
      The damage from sleep deficiency can occur in an instant (such as a car crash), or it can harm you over time.
      For example, ongoing sleep deficiency can raise your risk for some chronic health problems. It also can
      affect how well you think, react, work, learn, and get along with others.</p>
