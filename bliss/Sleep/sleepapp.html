  <h3><strong>Why Is Sleep Important?</strong></h3>
    <p>Sleep plays a vital role in maintaining one's health and well-being. Getting enough quality
      sleep at the right times helps protect mental and physical health, quality of life, and safety.
      The way you feel while you're awake depends in part on what happens while you're sleeping. During sleep,
      the body works to support healthy brain function and maintain your physical health. In children and
      teens, sleep also helps support growth and development. Ongoing sleep deficiency
      affects how well you think, react, work, learn, and get along with others.</p>
