  <h3><strong>How Does Water Affect My Health?</strong></h3>
  <p> Drinking water is critical to your survival and well-being. When the body is even slightly dehydrated, the effects are felt immediately - you may feel groggy, get headaches, or be unable to concentrate.</p>
<section>
    <p>Drinking water helps maintain the balance of body fluids. Your body is composed of about 60% water. Your bodily functions that include water are: digestion, absorption, circulation, creation of saliva, transportation of nutrients, and maintenance of body temperature. </p>
    <p>Water can help you control calories by substituting out higher calorie bevarages for water. </p>
    <p>Water helps to energize your muscles. Cells that don't maintain their balance of fluids and electrolytes will shrivel up , resulting in muscle fatigue that can damage your performance. </p>
    <p>Water helps to keep the skin look fresh. Your skin contains plenty of water that functions as a protective barrier. Hydration can prevent dry and wrinkled skin. </p>
